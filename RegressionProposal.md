# The Environmental Effect on Milk Production
  ## Regression Analysis
The food industry is growing rapidly. Therefore, making prediction for future is a necessary task to make sure that the supply continues and reduce 
any possible lose or waste. Dairy is one of the sectors that is based on milk production. 
The USDA wanted to make prediction of the milk production based on many factors that include the farm area, 
the number of operations in the state, the number of cows, the amount of calf on feed. This can be combined with seasonal changes 
such as the amount of rainfall, and the temperature that affect the production amount (Collier, 2017). 
Due to climate change, the USDA wanted a model that can predicate the production and draw conclusions from it.
### Analysis
I will use scrape data from two websites, the Census of Agriculture and the weather.com. Then, I will continue with the process of EDA and start the regression process. After that I will analyze the effect of the climate change on the production of milk.  
I would like to get your approval on my project that focuses on analyzing data to come up with a plan for this scenario.
